# Industrial Mathematics Group website

A fully static Astro site, deployed to GitHub Pages. There is no server, database or CMS.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                 # install from the lockfile
npm run dev            # local preview at http://localhost:4321
npm run check          # type check, build and internal link check; run before every PR
npm run test:scripts   # tests for the scripts in scripts/ and the two demos
```

The Node.js version is set in `.nvmrc`, and all workflows read it from there. To change it, edit that file and `engines` in `package.json`.

## Where things live

| To change | Edit |
|:---|:---|
| A person | `src/content/people/<name>.yaml` |
| A software package | `src/content/software/<name>.yaml` |
| A research area | `src/content/research/<order>-<name>.md` |
| A paper | `src/content/publications/<first-author-year>.yaml` |
| A news post | `src/content/news/<slug>.md` |
| Imprint and privacy | `src/content/legal/` |
| Name, contact address, navigation, external links | `src/data/site.ts` |
| Colours, type and layout | `src/styles/global.css` |
| Allowed fields for all content | `src/content.config.ts` |
| Front-page demo | `public/js/traffic.js` (drawing and controls) and `public/js/kinetic-traffic.js` (the model), explained in `src/content/news/traffic-demo.md` |
| The Explore section | `src/pages/explore/` (overview in `index.astro`); a package links to its page with `demo` ("Try it") or `explore` in its software entry |
| PDEStudio in the browser | `src/pages/explore/pdestudio.astro`, `public/js/pdestudio/` (panel rules in `logic.js`), data in `public/pdestudio/` |
| HyperCloud results | `src/pages/explore/hypercloud.astro`, images in `public/hypercloud/` |
| AI declarations | `src/pages/explore/ai-declarations.astro`, levels and rules in `src/lib/aisignoff.ts` (keep in step with the AI policy and aisignoff) |
| This repository's own AI declarations | `SIGNOFF.toml` (see *Pull requests* below) |

`src/data/zenodo.json` is written by `scripts/sync-zenodo.mjs` during deployment. Don't edit it by hand.

`public/pdestudio/*.json` is written by `tools/pdestudio-demo/export.jl` from the built-in examples of PDEStudioCore (the version pinned in its `Project.toml`). Don't edit it by hand; to update it, raise that version and run `julia --project=tools/pdestudio-demo tools/pdestudio-demo/export.jl` (instantiate the environment first). Keep `public/js/pdestudio/data.js` in step with the format.

`public/hypercloud/*.webp` are the figures of the HyperCloud preprint (sources in `meshfree-solver-paper`), converted from the PDEStudio exports with `uv run tools/hypercloud-figures/convert.py <folder of the exports>`. The captions on the page follow the preprint; change them together with it.

## Rules for content

- Never invent facts. People, roles, papers, dates, DOIs and results must come from a source you can point to, such as a repository, paper or the person concerned. If something is missing, leave it out and say so in the PR.
- Ask before adding personal details beyond what a person has published themselves. Don't add email addresses or photos without their consent.
- Math in Markdown uses `$...$` and `$$...$$`, rendered with KaTeX at build time.
- Write in plain, specific language. Describe what something does rather than promoting it.

## Rules for code

- Add content before adding components. Reuse what's in `src/components/` and `src/styles/global.css`.
- Use only the colour and font variables in `global.css`. Colours come from the logo kit in the org's `.github` repository.
- Keep the site static: no `output: 'server'`, adapters, analytics, cookies, or fonts and scripts from third-party hosts.
- Astro 7 rejects unclosed tags, and needs valid nesting (no `<div>` inside `<p>`).
- The build can run under a base path (GitHub Pages serves a repository that isn't the organisation site under `/<repository>/`, and the check workflow builds that way). In `.astro` files, write internal links and files from `public/` with `url()` from `src/data/site.ts`, e.g. `href={url('/software/')}`. In Markdown, plain links like `/software/` are fine; the build adds the base path. `npm run check` doesn't catch a missing `url()`, but the check workflow does.
- Every page must work without JavaScript. The two demos (the front page and PDEStudio in the browser) are the only exceptions, and their text must still make sense without it.
- The demo must stay pausable and must not start moving under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Pull requests

All changes go through a PR into `main` and land as a merge commit whose message is the PR title and description. Fill in the AI declaration in the PR template honestly, using the [group's AI policy](https://github.com/industrial-mathematics-group/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assisted-contributions). A person must take responsibility for each change.

The declaration is also what aisignoff reads: `SIGNOFF.toml` enables `[history]`, so the lines a PR changes take the levels ticked in its description (the merge commit's message). Lines whose commit declares nothing fall back to the annotations in `SIGNOFF.toml`. The *File-signoff* check runs `aisignoff lint` on every push and PR; each deployment publishes the folder report at `/signoff/`, which the AI declarations page shows in a frame (only when the build finds `public/signoff/index.html`; to see it locally, run `aisignoff report --html public/signoff/index.html --with-source` first). A commit on a PR branch may say a higher `AI-Generation` for the lines it wrote (e.g. an agent's commit with `AI-Generation: G3` and `Assisted-by: …` lines in its message).

The `site-preview` artifact on each PR contains the built site.

When you run through the `@claude` workflow, you push a branch and post a link to a pre-filled PR. Run `npm ci` and `npm run check` first. End your final comment with suggested AI declaration lines. Don't tick review levels for the human, who opens the PR and completes the declaration.

## Going live

`scripts/check-launch.mjs` stops deployment until the following are done. Don't weaken or remove this check to get a deployment through. The people responsible must supply the missing details.

- No `[TODO-LAUNCH: ...]` markers remain in `src/content/legal/`.
- `public/CNAME` contains the domain, and `domain` in `astro.config.mjs` uses the same one.
